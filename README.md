A simple little tool for replacing fmod **event** GUIDs of a *.bank file. Only works for event GUIDs, not effects or buses etc. Modifies the file in place, so make a backup of the old one. Only tested with bank files generated by `FMOD Studio 2.01.05`

### Usage:

List all event GUIDs:\
`guid_replacer.exe your_audio.bank`

Replace GUIDs:\
`guid_replacer.exe your_audio.bank [GUID to replace] [what to replace it with]`

### Example:

`guid_replacer.exe your_audio.bank {bc5e80f9-a380-47c9-8799-3e02eea94feb} {aabbccdd-eeff-00ff-aabb-feffefbbaacc}`

Multiple replacements can be chained like this:

`guid_replacer.exe your_audio.bank {GUID_A1} {GUID_A2} {GUID_B1} {GUID_B2}`
